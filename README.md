### Quick sneek on me

I'm an student in Engineering School studying all sorts of magic spells and brewing potions, in order to understand and tame the beast called "Computer".
I'm learning a lot by myself and i'm on a lot of different project at the same time, which is... somehow good for me ?

I'm interested in music, video games, travel, photography, climbing, and a lot of other stuff, enough to stop the list here.
